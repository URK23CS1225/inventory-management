I will upload one or more real retail CSV files containing product and sales data.
Use these CSV files directly as input for the project.

TASK:
Build an Inventory Management AI Agent using the uploaded CSV data.

WHAT TO DO WITH THE CSV FILES:

1. Inspect the uploaded CSV files and identify:
   - Product identifiers (SKU / product name)
   - Sales or demand-related columns
   - Any available inventory-related columns

2. If inventory stock levels are NOT present:
   - Derive daily demand from historical sales data
   - Create a simulated current_stock, max_capacity, and lead_time_days
   - Clearly treat stock and lead time as simulated but realistic values

3. Prepare two internal datasets:
   a) Inventory dataset:
      - product_id
      - product_name
      - current_stock
      - max_capacity
      - lead_time_days
   b) Demand dataset:
      - product_id
      - daily_demand

4. Compress the inventory dataset into inventory.csv.gz and use it as agent input.

AGENT LOGIC (MANDATORY):
- Observe inventory and demand
- Calculate days of stock left
- Compute stockout risk factor:
  risk_factor = lead_time_days / days_of_stock_left
- Classify risk as Low / Medium / High
- Decide whether to reorder and how much
- Act autonomously without human input

UNIQUE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Risk Factor–based decision making
2. Decision Timeline:
   - Log for each product:
     - Observed stock
     - Demand
     - Risk factor
     - Decision taken
     - Reason
     - Timestamp

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Build a Streamlit UI
- Inventory dashboard showing:
  product name, stock, demand, risk level, agent action
- Product detail view showing:
  risk factor
  full decision timeline
- Agent reasoning panel in natural language

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Treat uploaded CSV data as real product data
- Clearly separate real product information from simulated inventory values
- Focus on explainability, transparency, and AI-agent behavior
- Use Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Streamlit
